# BULLET

This repository contains the source code for BULLET, a cutting-edge low-jitter NextG uplink scheduling technique designed for high-quality real-time communications. This work has been submitted to INFOCOM 2025.

## Key Features

- **Performance enhancement**: Achieves up to 2.6X enhancement in bitrate for both open-source WebRTC and commercial video conferencing applications.
- **Ease of deployment**: Requires only modifications to the RAN intelligent controller within Open-RAN frameworks.
- **Scalability**: Applicable for most of real-time communications applications that use standard RTP/RTCP header format.

We are currently in the process of refining the code to enhance usability. Stay tuned for updates!
